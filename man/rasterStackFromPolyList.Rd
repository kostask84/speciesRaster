\title{Polygon List to rasterStack}
\usage{
rasterStackFromPolyList(polyList, resolution = 50000,
  retainSmallRanges = TRUE, extent = "auto", nthreads = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{polyList}{a list of SpatialPolygon objects, named with taxon names}

\item{resolution}{vertical and horizontal size of raster cell, in units 
of the polygons' projection}

\item{retainSmallRanges}{boolean; should small ranged species be dropped or preserved.
See details.}

\item{extent}{if 'auto', then the maximal extent of the polygons will be used. 
If not auto, must be a numeric vector of length 4 with minLong, maxLong, minLat, maxLat.}

\item{nthreads}{number of threads to use for parallelization of the function. The R
package    \code{parallel} must be loaded for \code{nthreads > 1}.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{RasterStack} where all rasters contain values of 
either NA or 1.
}
\description{
Takes a list of polygons and creates a rasterStack.
}
\details{
In the rasterization process, all cells for which the polygon covers the midpoint are
	considered as present and receive a value of 1. If \code{retainSmallRanges = FALSE}, 
	then species whose ranges are so small that no cell registers as present will be 
	dropped. If \code{retainSmallRanges = TRUE}, then the cells that the small polygon
	is found in will be considered as present.
